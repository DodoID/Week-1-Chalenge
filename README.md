# Project task:
* AS A marketing agency I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.


* Outcome:

  * #Modified htm naming, for a better understanding of the page.
  * #Applied a code correction for the HEader H1 text to show the logo clearly
  * #Added some semantic text to the header function, unable to change the <div> to <section> and make it work! (Maybe I understood wrongly the usage of semantic fuctions)
  * #Added alt text to the photos and renamed Hero section to photo, and changed the configuration of the link from the CSS to the HTML so I can add the ALt Text Function.
  * #Added explanations to the CSS and rearanged it for better accesibility 
  * Reduced size of the images
